# [Andres’s Agentic AI SOC Automation Platform]()  





## 🤖 Agentic AI SOC Analyst Project Overview
This repository documents the development of my home lab Agentic AI SOC Analyst built to assist with automated threat hunting, log analysis, and incident response workflows in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

Rather than being a collection of generic Python labs, each module represents a practical component of an agent-driven security automation pipeline, including:
- AI-assisted threat hunting via structured tool calls
- Log Analytics querying with guardrails (time limits, row limits)
- Human-in-the-loop containment actions (VM isolation)
- Defensive validation of model outputs (tables, fields, models)
- Production-safe API integrations (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint & Log Analytics)

Python is used not just for scripting, but as the orchestration layer that connects LLM reasoning, security tooling, and operational safeguards into a cohesive agentic system.

Unlike simple scripts, the agent operates within a controlled loop that combines:
- LLM reasoning
- tool execution
- policy guardrails
- human-in-the-loop decision making
